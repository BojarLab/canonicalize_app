# IUPAC Glycan Sequence Canonicalizer

A simple web application for canonicalizing IUPAC glycan sequences using the `glycowork` Python package.

## About

This tool provides a convenient interface to convert glycan sequences into their canonicalized IUPAC representation. Simply paste your sequences, click convert, and get standardized results instantly.

## Features

- Easy-to-use web interface
- Batch processing of multiple sequences
- Instant conversion using the `canonicalize_iupac` function from glycowork
- Error handling for invalid sequences

## Usage

1. Enter one or more glycan sequences in the input text area (one per line)
2. Click the "Convert" button
3. View and copy the canonicalized sequences from the output area
